#Project v.01


## Project Title

Tik Tak Toe

### Description

This is my very first web app project and will be continuously improved in the near future.I have started with simple logic and improved the accuracy of the game over time. The current version is V.01.


### Prerequisites

Please note that this version(V.01) is not compatible with mobile devices.


### Executing

I recommend using google chrome to play the game (V.1). I will be making it compatible with smaller screens.


### playing

3. You can enter your name inside the placeholders at the bottom of the screen (pls check the upcoming V.02).
4. The next turn will be displayed on the top part of the game. It also displays the winner and Draw( pls check the upcoming v.03)
5. Simply click on the 'Restart' button to restart the game.
